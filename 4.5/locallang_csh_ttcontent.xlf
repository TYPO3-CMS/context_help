This is a description of the various types:

&lt;strong&gt;Header&lt;/strong&gt;
This type allows you to insert a standard Content Element header and nothing more.
Almost all the other types described below also include the Header and its options. The Header type provides a way to insert a header without any other content.

&lt;strong&gt;Text&lt;/strong&gt;
The Text type allows you to insert regular page content. It is generally used for text only content.

&lt;strong&gt;Text &amp; Images&lt;/strong&gt;
This is the same as the Text type (regular page content) but with the option of attaching images.

&lt;strong&gt;Image&lt;/strong&gt;
The Image type allows you to insert image only page content.

&lt;strong&gt;Bullet List&lt;/strong&gt;
Lets you create a bullet list. Each line in the text field will appear as a single bullet.

&lt;strong&gt;Table&lt;/strong&gt;
Lets you create &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt; tables. Each line represents a row in the table and vertical bars ('|') separate each column. A popup wizard is also available.

&lt;strong&gt;File Links&lt;/strong&gt;
Allows you to present a list of files for download. Thumbnails can be attached to the list and you can also display the file size.

&lt;strong&gt;Form&lt;/strong&gt;
Lets you create mail forms using a special syntax or a popup wizard.

&lt;strong&gt;Search&lt;/strong&gt;
This inserts a search box and also shows the search results when a search is performed on the page.

&lt;strong&gt;Login&lt;/strong&gt;
Displays a login box for website users. This is only useful if you have already created website users and usergroups.

&lt;strong&gt;Menu/Sitemap&lt;/strong&gt;
Offers a selection of menus and a sitemap you can insert on a page.

&lt;strong&gt;Insert records&lt;/strong&gt;
This acts as placeholder for other records. With this Content Element, you can resuse multiple content elements from other pages.

&lt;strong&gt;Insert plugin&lt;/strong&gt;
This will allows you to insert news, forums, guestbooks, lists of addresses, and other functionality. Plugins are typically provided by TYPO3 extensions. The available fields and required configuration depend on the extension.

&lt;strong&gt;Divider&lt;/strong&gt;
This inserts a simple horizontal rule on a page.

&lt;strong&gt;HTML&lt;/strong&gt;
This is plain HTML content. Anything added in the HTML Code of this Content Element will be displayed directly on the page without any preprocessing.</source>

The field is reused in other Content Element types so changing the type will cause any text to be reused in that new Content Element type.

When you're using this field with the "Text" and "Text &amp; Images" types, the content is normal body text. Each linebreak signifies a new paragraph, you can use the special TYPO3 tag, &amp;lt;LINK&amp;gt;, for making links. You can use many HTML tags but there are limitations depending on your website configuration.
A Rich Text Editor is commonly used to add a visual editing interface for 'Text' and 'Text &amp; Images' Content Elements.

&lt;b&gt;Bullet Lists:&lt;/b&gt;
If the type is "Bullet List" each line in this field is a bullet item.

&lt;b&gt;Tables:&lt;/b&gt;
If the type is "Table" each line represents a table row. Within each line, columns are divided by a vertical bar ('|'). A table row with 3 columns could look like "This is column 1 | Column 2 here | Third column!". The table wizard can also be used for creating tables and is much easier than hand coding them.

&lt;b&gt;Parameters:&lt;/b&gt;
Types like "Form" and "Multimedia" use this field for parameters than can be passed to the Content Element. The "HTML" type expects raw HTML which is simply displayed on the website without any processing.

&lt;b&gt;Making a mail form:&lt;/b&gt;
When you have selected the "Form" Content Element you can enter form field and other options. This is a brief example:

Your name: | *name=input,40 | [Enter name!]
Your email: | *email=input,40
Your address: | address=textarea,40,10
Your haircolor: |hair=radio|Blue=blue, Red=red

|formtype_mail = submit | Send Form
|subject=hidden| Enter a subject here!
|html_enabled=hidden | 1

The first two lines makes input fields for name and email. Both are marked as "required" and are designated by the *, and the name field has a default value of "[Enter name!]".
The third line is a text box and the fourth makes radio buttons to select a hair color.
After the input fields, there are three important lines in the end. The first makes a submit button with the label "Send Form", the second line is the subject of the email the receiver gets, and the third line formats the email using HTML.
Like the table wizard, it is easier to use the form wizard rather than hand coding the forms.

&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; For a form to work you must add an email address for the Recipient Email in its field.</source>

A table row with 3 columns could look like "This is column 1 | Column 2 here | Third column!". The table wizard can also be used for creating tables and is much easier than hand coding them.

&lt;b&gt;Parameters:&lt;/b&gt;
Types like "Form" and "Multimedia" use this field for parameters than can be passed to the Content Element. The "HTML" type expects raw HTML which is simply displayed on the website without any processing.

&lt;b&gt;Making a mail form:&lt;/b&gt;
When you have selected the "Form" Content Element you can enter form field and other options. This is a brief example:

Your name: | *name=input,40 | [Enter name!]
Your email: | *email=input,40
Your address: | address=textarea,40,10
Your haircolor: |hair=radio|Blue=blue, Red=red

|formtype_mail = submit | Send Form
|subject=hidden| Enter a subject here!
|html_enabled=hidden | 1

The first two lines makes input fields for name and email. Both are marked as "required" and are designated by the *, and the name field has a default value of "[Enter name!]".
The third line is a text box and the fourth makes radio buttons to select a hair color.
After the input fields, there are three important lines in the end. The first makes a submit button with the label "Send Form", the second line is the subject of the email the receiver gets, and the third line formats the email using HTML.
Like the table wizard, it is easier to use the form wizard rather than hand coding the forms.

&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; For a form to work you must add an email address for the Recipient Email in its field.</target>

				<source>The positions above and below the body text are pretty straight forward.
The options for "In text" mean that images are displayed with text wrapped around them. When you select this option the template will probably force the images into smaller dimensions to accomodate the width of the template and the width of the text. The bodytext will float &lt;em&gt;under&lt;/em&gt; the image block when it reaches the end of the image block. In other words, the body text &lt;em&gt;wraps around&lt;/em&gt; the image block. If you select "In text" below the "No wrap" divider, the body text will not float under the image block, but simply continue in its column.
Apart from the visual difference there is a technical aspect as well. If you choose to allow the content to wrap the image block you will experience a strange phenomenon when you do not have enough bodytext to make it float around the image: subsequent content elements on the page will appear to be layered on top of the image block. However it's easily solved by changing the "In text" position to the equal value but below the "No wrap" divider.</source>

				<source>This field is used by many of the Content Element types to create a relation to either a single target page or multiple target pages. If no target page is specified, the current page will generally be used.

Using the "Search" Content Element, the target page is where search results will appear. You must make sure that this page has a similar "Search" Content Element to display the results.

The "Login" Content Element (not to be confused with the Login plugin available when the felogin extension is installed) also uses this field to redirect the login to a certain page. That page does not need to contain a "Login" Content Element in order to perform the authentication since any TYPO3 page can handle a login request.
If you specify a second page in this list, the ID will be passed to the login system as the page inside TYPO3 where website users are found. You should use this only if your template is not already configured to pass this value on.
In order for the login procedure to work you must make sure that you have created website users and website usergroups, have specified where these website users can be found (typically a SysFolder), a page ID in the page list, and ensured that cookies are enabled for the site.

The "Menu/Sitemap" Content Elements also use this field. In this case the page will determine the starting point for the menu or the actual pages shown in the menu. This behavior depends on the menu type you have selected.

Finally the "Form" element uses this field as the target page to which the form is submitted. A common use is the "Thank you" page after the form is completed.</source>

The "Menu/Sitemap" Content Elements also use this field. In this case the page will determine the starting point for the menu or the actual pages shown in the menu. This behavior depends on the menu type you have selected.

Finally the "Form" element uses this field as the target page to which the form is submitted. A common use is the "Thank you" page after the form is completed.</target>

				<source>This is a short description of each type:

&lt;strong&gt;Menu of selected pages&lt;/strong&gt;
This will create a menu with links to the pages in the Selected Pages list.

&lt;strong&gt;Menu of subpages of selected pages&lt;/strong&gt;
This will create in a menu with links to the subpages of the pages in the Selected Pages list. If you do not specify any pages, the subpages to the current page will be used.

&lt;strong&gt;Menu of subpages of selected pages (with abstract)&lt;/strong&gt;
Like the previous option, but also displays the content of the Abstract field (or the Description field) for each page in the menu. The Abstract field is given priority over the Description field if both are complete.

&lt;strong&gt;Menu of subpages of selected pages + sections&lt;/strong&gt;
Like the previous option, but includes links to all Content Elements on the page that are marked to Show In Section Menus.

&lt;strong&gt;Sitemap&lt;/strong&gt;
Generates a classic tree sitemap. Notice that the sitemap will begin from the current page unless you select another page instead.

&lt;strong&gt;Section index (page content marked for section menus)&lt;/strong&gt;
This makes a menu of Content Elements on the selected pages for all Content Elements marked to Show In Section Menu. This is a great way to make an index at the top of the page.
If you don't want certain Content Elements to appear in the list, just uncheck the Show in Section Menus checkbox for those elements.

&lt;strong&gt;Recently updated pages&lt;/strong&gt;
This displays the 10 most recently updated pages.
&lt;strong&gt;Notice:&lt;/strong&gt; If you update a page and the updated page is not included in this list, clearing the Page Cache will resolve the issue.

&lt;strong&gt;Related pages (based on keywords)&lt;/strong&gt;
Displays other related pages based on the keywords of the selected pages matched against the keywords of other pages.
