				<source>The 'Template' records are the vital components used to set the design of the webpages. No matter how (almost) you would like to build your website, it must be initiated by a 'Template' record placed in the root of the page tree of the site.
Basically, create a 'Template' record, enter a title and make sure to check of Clear constants, setup and Rootline. Then enter some TypoScript configuration in the Setup field and you're set.
It's very important to read how to do all this in the documents listed below! Also make sure you use the Web&gt;Template module to do all the working with templates. It's a specialized tool to help you with this.</source>
