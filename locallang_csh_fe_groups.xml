			<label index="hidden.description">This option disables the user group.</label>
			<label index="hidden.details">If you disable a user group all users which are members of the group will in effect not inherit any properties this group may have given them.
For instance if a page or content element was assigned access only by this group and you disable the group, no one would gain access to that page or content element.</label>

			<label index="title.description">Name of the group.</label>
			<label index="title.details">This title will appear as the group name in the 'Access'-list in other records.</label>
			<label index="lockToDomain.description">Enter the host name from which the group will be available only.</label>
			<label index="lockToDomain.details">This options may be important if you have multiple websites in the same TYPO3 database but still only one main storage page for all Website users. Thus the users may log in on any of the website URLs. This may be considered a feature (having a global login as a user) or a problem (in which case you should have multiple user storages anyway). However you may wish to limit the use of a Website usergroup to a specific website and thus you don't want the group to be enabled for the user when he logs in at another URL (still from the same database of course). By entering the host name of the website here, you restrict the group to be used only from within this domain.

&lt;b&gt;Notice:&lt;/b&gt; The use for this option is not critical if you have multiple Website user storages, namely one for each site.</label>

			<label index="description.details">This is for internal use and is just a way to put a note on what the group is for, why you created it and who should be members.
Use it as you like.</label>
			<label index="TSconfig.description">TSconfig for the group (advanced).</label>
			<label index="TSconfig.details">This is the user TSconfig for the group. The values are inherited by any Website user who is a member of this group.
The configuration is subject to being overridden in other groups and by the TSconfig of the user himself.</label>
